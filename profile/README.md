## 🚀 What is crewd.?

**Crewd** is a platform for the modern workforce — we help **gig & temp workers** build verifiable work histories and give **employers** fast, fraud-free hiring tools.

🧠 Think **Carfax for employment** — but the worker owns the data.  
🔗 Powered by **blockchain**, **DIDs**, and **verifiable credentials (VCs)**.
